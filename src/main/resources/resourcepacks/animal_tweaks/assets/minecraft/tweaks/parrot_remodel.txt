    What is a Tweak?

        Tweaks are client side modifications.
        They are .txt files stored in the "minecraft/tweaks/" folder of resource packs,
        each of them alters specific aspects of your game as long as Spawn is installed.
        By including the desired tweaks in your resource pack, you can selectively activate features like model enhancements, animation freshen-ups and visual changes.
        The "Animal Tweaks" resource pack, bundled with Spawn, automatically contains all available tweaks for you to choose from.

    What is a Tweak?

        Tweaks are client side modifications.
        They are .txt files stored in the "minecraft/tweaks/" folder of resource packs,
        each of them alters specific aspects of your game as long as Spawn is installed.
        By including the desired tweaks in your resource pack, you can choose to activate features like model enhancements, animation freshen-ups and visual changes.
        The "Animation Tweaks" and the "Model Tweaks" resource packs, bundled with Spawn, contain all available respective tweaks for you to choose from, go check the GitHub to see!
